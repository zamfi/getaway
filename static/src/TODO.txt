#1. Slow down everything
#2. Slow down, and space out spawned entities
#3. Abstract representations  (choose from random mix bag) for entities 
#4. Right pane
    #4.1 Removes the scores, arrow images
    #4.2 Mapping entities 
    #4.3 Change the road image
#5. Distance Mark function
#6. One thing marked at the time - need more details
7. Interface panel - tied to time function, question
    #7.1 Display keyboard key icons next to item legend
    #7.2 Display the question - "What is the boxed item?"
    #7.3 Keyboard interface for providing input
        #7.3.1 hold frame color green
        #7.3.2 hold frame color red
        #7.3.3 blink frame color blue
        #7.3.4 Map keys - Q, W, E
        #7.3.5 Get only one input per box and store it in boxedType variable (undecided, cash, life, obstacles)
        #7.3.6 When rendering cash, life, obstacles, 
                #7.3.6.1 #if asset.boxed is false, then auto-set asset.recognizedType to cash, life, obstacle
                        #else if asset.boxed is true, then set asset.recognizedType to undecided isUnrecognized
                #7.3.6.2 set asset.recognizedType to user input value
        7.3.7 Set Timeout distance, amd mark incorrect and red
    7.4 Bar for time remaining
        #7.4.1 Vary boxing distances (aka timeout for system recognition failure) only for attention query 
                #Other siwse fixed distance (1/3 down) - 3 car lengths?
        #7.4.2 Calculate time remaining based on speed and remaining distance
        #7.4.3 Visualize time bar - for time remaining
        7.4.4 if time elapses - give -ve feedback - blink frame red
            7.4.4.1 Use QUERY_TIMEOUT(4000ms) to decide this
            7.4.4.2 Update a QUERY_TIMEOUT_FLAG
        #7.4.5 isBoxed is a misnomer - 
        7.4.6 Make time bar aesthetically nice
    #7.5 Separate pane for the interface - look at the amendment document
    #7.6 Move car all way down
    #7.7 Give feedback for keyboard key presses - Q,W,E
    7.8 Diasble time remaining, and other query related parameters when there is no active question
8. Box them based on two different criteria
    #8.1 Environment query - based on hard time constraint rather than probablity
    #8.2 Attention query -  based on probablity (existing one)
    #8.3 Deploy attention query only when Environment query is inactive
        #8.3.1 Environment query takes precedence
        #8.3.2 Should not be posed around a time window of the Env. query
    8.4 Define probablity time constants and other coefficients and time interval parameters
        8.4.1 Use pilots for tuning this right
    
#9. Car controller for driving this - PID
    #9.1 Controller triggered upon human identification for unknown objects
    9.2 Deactivate controller once it has crossed timeout distance? (How would we calculate time left, should we calculate till threshold?)
    9.3 Get the controller tied with gamespeed 
    9.4 Activate controller for boxed objects with Attn query once we go below a specific time threshold


#10. Distractor task panel
    #10.1 Arithmethic tasks
        #10.1.1 A subtraction task with 1 digit answer
        #10.1.2 Green and Red hold for distractor panel for correct and wrong answer
        #10.1.3 Set distractor task pause between tasks
        10.1.4 Timer for this

11. Data collection
    11.1 Number of obstacles, points and extra life
    11.2 Timelog of events 
        11.2.1 Timed Generation log
        11.2.2 Timed User input log 
        11.2.3 (x,y) coords of all assets when a query and user i/p was recorded
        11.2.4 Time of change of icons

12. Add termination condition
    12.1 - Time-based (Game ends after a specific time)
13. Random scoring function










*. Take parameters as JSON file
*. Ready JS for mechanical turk
    - jsTurk(?) - jsPsych
*. Scaling to different display resolution
